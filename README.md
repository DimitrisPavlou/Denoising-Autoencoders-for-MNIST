# Denoising Autoencoders for MNIST  

This project implements two types of denoising autoencoders for the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits:  

- **MLP-based autoencoder**  
- **Convolutional autoencoder**  

Both models are trained to remove noise from corrupted digit images, effectively learning how to reconstruct clean digits.
